# Yield Prediction in Agriculture

## Overview
This project aims to predict agricultural yields using machine learning algorithms. It leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and XGBoost to process and analyze data related to agricultural factors influencing yield.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and all required libraries installed.
2. Run the script with a dataset in the expected format (the dataset is assumed to be private and not included in this repository).

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the accuracy or efficiency of the model are welcome. Please ensure adherence to coding standards and provide documentation for your changes.
